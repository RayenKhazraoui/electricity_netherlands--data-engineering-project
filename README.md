#Weather & Electricity Forecasting Pipeline ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

This project pulls together weather data (KNMI & Open-Meteo) and electricity data (ENTSO-E), stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and uses XGBoost to forecast energy demand and solar/wind generation. Everything is automated using Airflow running in Docker on my old laptop (setup as a Linux server).

Historical data is used to create forecasting models.

# Data sources

- **KNMI API** â€“ historical weather (hourly/daily)
- **ENTSO-E API** â€“ historical electricity data (load, market, generation)
- **Open-Meteo** â€“ weather forecasts (temp, radiation, wind, etc.)

- XGBoost was used to build models for:
 - **Electricity load** prediction using time features (hour, weekday, month, etc.) and temperature
 - **Solar & wind generation** prediction using additional weather features like shortwave radiation, wind speed, and gusts
- The models essentially combine time series structure with weather-based features to improve accuracy


- Historical data is pulled daily (electricity + weather) and upserted into db
- Forecasts run hourly using Open-Meteo
- Load & solar/wind generation predictions are written to Postgres
- Everything is visualized in Power BI using the same database
